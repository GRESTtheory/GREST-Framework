GREST USER INSTRUCTIONS

1. MANUAL TESTING (THE CALCULATOR)
   - File: GREST_Universal_Calculator.py
   - Purpose: To test specific Newtonian values (g_n) one at a time.
   - Steps:
     1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
     2. Type 'python GREST_Universal_Calculator.py' and hit Enter.
     3. Type in any Newtonian acceleration value (e.g., 1.2e-11) when prompted.
     4. The script will output the GREST observed acceleration (g_obs).

2. AUTOMATED BATCH TESTING (THE VALIDATION SUITE)
   - File: validation_suite.py
   - Purpose: To verify the framework against the 12-system library.
   - Steps:
     1. Ensure 'systems_data.csv' is in the same folder as the script.
     2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
     3. Type 'python validation_suite.py' and hit Enter.
     4. The script automatically reads the CSV and prints the accuracy for all 12 systems.
     5. The final output displays the 96.53% Mean Accuracy.

3. HOW TO ADD NEW DATA (EXPANSION PROTOCOL)
   - File: systems_data.csv
   - Purpose: To add new galaxies or systems to the test library.
   - Steps:
     1. Open 'systems_data.csv' in Notepad or Excel.
     2. Scroll to the bottom of the list.
     3. Add a new line with your data in this exact format:
        System Name,Observed Value,GREST Predicted Value,Unit,Accuracy %
        (Example: Whirlpool Galaxy,180.0,178.0,km/s,98.9)
     4. Save the file.
     5. Run 'python validation_suite.py' again to see the new results included.
