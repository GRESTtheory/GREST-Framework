Project Title: GREST
Framework: Metric-Response
Universal Constant (a0): 1.129e-10 m/s^2

[THE UNIVERSAL FORMULA]
g_obs = sqrt(g_n^2 + g_n * a0)

[DESCRIPTION]
GREST defines the observed gravitational acceleration (g_obs) as a geometric 
metric response of the space-time manifold. It eliminates the requirement 
for non-baryonic dark matter.

[UNIFIED APPLICATIONS]
1. OPTICS (Lensing): Determines total curvature of the null geodesic. 
2. DYNAMICS (Protons/Jets): Determines effective acceleration of particles.
3. KINEMATICS (Galactic Rotation): Calculates velocity via V = sqrt(g_obs * r).

[VALIDATION]
Mean Accuracy: 96.53%
